## Contributing to the Roadmap

This roadmap is a living document. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

### How to Suggest Features

1. Open an issue with the `feature-request` label
2. Describe the feature and its benefits
3. Indicate which phase it might fit into
4. Discuss implementation approach

### Prioritization Criteria

Features are prioritized based on:
- **Impact**: How many users benefit?
- **Effort**: How complex is implementation?
- **Risk**: Could it introduce bugs or instability?
- **Dependencies**: Does it block other features?
- **Community Interest**: How many users requested it?
